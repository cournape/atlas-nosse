 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * Mjoin( PATL, tbsvUHN ) solves the following triangular system of equations
 *
 *    conjg( A' ) * x = b,
 *
 * where b and x are n-element vectors and  A is an n by n non-unit, up-
 * per triangular band matrix, with ( k + 1 ) diagonals.
 *
 * No test for  singularity  or  near-singularity  is included  in  this
 * routine. Such tests must be performed before calling this routine.
 *
 * This is a  recursive  version of the  algorithm.  For a more detailed
 * description of  the arguments of this function, see the reference im-
 * plementation in the  ATLAS/src/blas/reference directory.
